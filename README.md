# Lung Cancer Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting lung cancer using machine learning classification models. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation using multiple performance metrics.

The main implementation is provided in the Jupyter Notebook:

**Lung Cancer Prediction.ipynb**

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  
## Technologies & Libraries
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure
 Lung Cancer Prediction.ipynb
 README.md
 Requirements.txt

## Dataset
The dataset contains medical and lifestyle-related features used to predict lung cancer, such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Smoking habits
- Symptoms and health conditions

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using:
  Accuracy
  Precision
  Recall
  F1-score
  Confusion Matrix

## Results
The notebook compares multiple machine learning models and identifies the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics. Performance comparison helps in selecting the most suitable model for lung cancer prediction.

## Future Improvements
 Perform advanced feature engineering
 Try additional models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
 Apply hyperparameter tuning techniques
 Deploy the model as a web application
